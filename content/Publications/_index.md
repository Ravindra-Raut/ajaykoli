abstract = "Genetic improvement of crop plants is not new; we have been modifying
plant genomes for thousands of years for our well-being. Development of
transgenic crop plants is an outcome of increasing human population and
incidence of biotic/abiotic stress determinants. The cost-effective approach
of genetic engineering allows for a relatively fast cross-species gene transfer.
A number of crop plants have been genetically engineered for resistance
to insect pests, fungal and viral pathogens, nematodes etc. using a variety
of approaches. Genetically modified crop plants have been developed for
tolerance to various abiotic stress conditions such as osmosis, salt, drought,
temperature, environmental pollutants and so on. Plants have been engineered
for better nutrient utilization as well as enhancement of nutrition
quality in food. Crop plants have been engineered for molecular farming
in order to generate sufficient antigenic vaccines, antibodies, netraceutical
and therapeutic proteins. Recently, plant genomes have also been modified
for enhancement in the production of biofuel. It is natural to think about the
biosafety aspects of transgenic crop plants especially with respect to health
and ecological issues. The cause of concern arises due to the phenomena
of various types of gene flow in nature. The selectable markers can be
removed from the genetically engineered plants using approaches such as
co-transformation, multi-autotransformation, site-specific recombination,
Cre/lox recombination system etc. Recently, genome editing technology,
which allows plant breeding without introducing a transgene, is expected to
generate many new crop varieties with traits that can satisfy various kinds of
demands for commercialization genetically improved crop plants"
