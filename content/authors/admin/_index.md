I am a PhD Student with research experience in experimental & computational genomics, next-generation DNA/RNA sequencing, and transposable element analysis. Currently, I'm interested in developing and computational programming methods to genomic data, with the aim of improving molecular biology, genetics. I'm always looking to connect with people in related fields and explore opportunities.
