ðŸš¨**Right now  seeking a full time teaching faculty position.** ðŸš¨

Earlier I worked as an Assistant Professor of Research Methodology and Sustainability at the Pune Institute of Business Management, Pune (from 11 Feb 2019 to 11 August 2020). 

I further like to teach research methods (quantitative as well as qualitative) using [R](https://www.r-project.org/). I used open-source software R to promote reproducibility and transparency in research.

I like to read, think and write about waste, environment, & sanitation workers from the perspective of sustainability science.
