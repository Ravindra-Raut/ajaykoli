abstract: Sericulture is a labor-intensive agro-based rural industry, which covers silkworm food plants, silkworm rearing, silk reeling, spinning, yarn twisting, dyeing, weaving, printing, finishing, and related processes. In the year 2010-11, the sericulture sector's employment increased to 72.5 lakh persons in India (viz. 52.20 lakh farmers, 3.70 lakh reelers, and 16.60 lakh weavers) from 68.17 lakh persons during 2009-10. Approximately  89% of the silk produced in India is mulberry silk. The total area under mulberry plantation was 1.70 lakh hectares during 2010-11. Production of raw mulberry silk was 16360 MT, including Bivoltine (1400 MT). Moreover, Crossbreed (14960 MT). Other Vanya raw silk production was 4050 MT, which includes Tasar (1166 MT), Eri (2760 MT), and Muga (124 MT). Thus raw silk production during 2010-11 was 20410 MT. During 2010-11, India exported Rs.2723.86 Crores of raw silk. The items of silk exported include natural silk yam fabrics, made-ups (1578.40 Crores), readymade garments (1095.1 Crores), silk carpets (15.84 Crores), and silk waste (34.52 Crores). India exports raw silk mainly to Hong Kong (INR 6188 million), the USA (INR 3703.5 million), UK (INR 2528.4 million), UAE (INR 2391.1 million), and Germany (INR 1388.4 million).
