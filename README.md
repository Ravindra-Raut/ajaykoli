Hi, I'm Ravindra 👋
visitors

I work on the Visual Studio Code team at Microsoft.
What am I up to?
🔭 I’m currently ramping up for my new gig on the VS Code team 😁
🌱 I’ve also been learning about the Jupyter Notebooks ecosystem over in .NET Interactive 📓
🤔 I’m looking for help maintaining the PowerShell Pester Test Explorer 🐢✅
Bio
👀 All my work is open source 👀

Sometimes people give me a mic and I talk about 💻. You can also find me on Twitch live-coding 👨‍💻 📺 projects of all kinds. I also like ☕️ with the word "mouthfeel" on the packaging.

🙂 My preferred pronouns are: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I'm originally from Florida 🌴 but don't hold that against me 😉
